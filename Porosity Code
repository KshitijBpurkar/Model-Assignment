The Code:

#Importing Libraries
import numpy as np
import cv2 as cv

#Reading Image and Converting into Canny
img=cv.imread("Photos/Metal picture.png") #reading image
canny=cv.Canny(img,150,175)

w,h =img.shape[1],img.shape[0] #Reading dimensions of the image
low=0                          #To count pixels will low intensity
mean=np.average(canny)          #Average of all pixels

for element in img[:]:       #Each row of image array
    for value in element[:]: #Each pixel in row
     if(value[0]<mean):
         low+=1           #Counting pixels with low intensity

porosity=float(low/(w*h))*100              #Expressing porosity as percentage
print("Porosity is "+"%.4f" %porosity+"%") #Printing value of porosity

cv.imshow("Canny",canny)
cv.waitKey(0)
